### Sombrero Raytracer for X-ray Optics

This code was developed by me while I was pursuing my Ph.D. at Cornell University in the Laboratory of Plasma Studies. 

My thesis research involved x-ray physics and Bragg optics. I was interested in developing a fully-3D x-ray raytracer to aid in my experimental setup and analysis.

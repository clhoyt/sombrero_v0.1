### Sombrero Raytracer for X-ray Optics

This code was developed by me while I was pursuing my Ph.D. at Cornell University in the Laboratory of Plasma Studies.

My thesis research involved x-ray scattering physics and Bragg optics in the field of high energy density plasma physics. I was interested in developing a fully-3D x-ray raytracer to aid in my experimental setup and analysis.
